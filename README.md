<h1>Keylogger</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a Python Keylogger. The program was made from the perspective of an insider threat planting a keylogger on an internal linux system to gather potential sensitive information. Upon execution, the program will begin to track all keystrokes made across the linux system. The program will output saved keystrokes into a log file for the user to view. Because this program was made from the perspective of an insider threat, the log file is not sent to a remote system or server. It is instead stored in a hidden directory called "hide" where the insider threat can later retrieve the log data and cover their tracks. This program uses the pynput input library to capture keystrokes. Testing for this program was completed in Kali Linux and Ubuntu environments.
